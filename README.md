## About the IPL Dataset

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during April-May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all the sports leagues. It has teams with players from around the world and is very competitive and entertaining with a lot of close matches between teams.

The IPL and other cricket related datasets are available at `cricsheet.org`. Feel free to visit the website and explore the data by yourself as exploring new sources of data is one of the interesting activities a data scientist gets to do.

So let's get started with the first IPL match that was played in 2008. It turned out to be a run fest.
Remember, Brendon McCullum (BAZ) had scored a century?

Let's explore the first match data to find out what happened in the match.
