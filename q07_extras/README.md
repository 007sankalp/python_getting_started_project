## How many more "extras" (wides, legbyes, etc) were bowled in the second innings as compared to the first inning?

* The task is to find the number of more **extras** bowled in the second innings, compared to first.

You will get to use one of the binary operators, we studied in the class.

Seems interesting, right?

The function must return an integer.

_Hint: Find the total count of extras bowled in the first innings, and the total count of extras bowled in the second innings. Subtract them._
