## Task 4: Ricky Ponting batted in the first innings. 

KKR was graced to have the 2 times World Cup winning captain and legendary batsman RICKY PONTING in their side.

He had walked in a tricky situation, and played perfect foil to McCullum.

How many deliveries did he bat??

* Save the number of balls faced by Ricky Ponting in the first innings in a variable `count`.

We bet, you can do it.

Right?
